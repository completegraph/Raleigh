  abstract = {Background The main objective of this study is to apply autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to make real-time predictions on the number of beds occupied in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, during the recent SARS outbreak. Methods This is a retrospective study design. Hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14th March 2003 to 31st May 2003. The main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients. Among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted (including observation, suspect and probable cases) and days from the most recent significant event discovery. We utilized the following strategy for the analysis. Firstly, we split the outbreak data into two. Data from 14th March to 21st April 2003 was used for model development. We used structural ARIMA models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied. Estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the Kalman filter. For the ARIMA model parameters, we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model. Results We found that the ARIMA (1,0,3) model was able to describe and predict the number of beds occupied during the SARS outbreak well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the training set and validation set were 5.7\% and 8.6\% respectively, which we found was reasonable for use in the hospital setting. Furthermore, the model also provided three-day forecasts of the number of beds required. Total number of admissions and probable cases admitted on the previous day were also found to be independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy. Conclusion ARIMA models provide useful tools for administrators and clinicians in planning for real-time bed capacity during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. The model could well be used in planning for bed-capacity during outbreaks of other infectious diseases as well.},

  abstract = {Objective Influenza is a common childhood disease and protecting children by predicting the positive rate of influenza virus is important as vaccines are not routinely administered in China. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology of influenza viruses among children in Wuhan, China during the past nine influenza seasons (2007\textendash 2015) and to predict the positive rate of different types of influenza virus in the future. Methods During the last nine influenza seasons (2007\textendash 2015), a total of 10,232 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pediatric outpatients (age {$<$}15years) with influenza-like illness (ILI) infections in two sentinel children's hospitals were examined for influenza A and B by real-time one step RT-PCR. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to fit the time series and to predict the future (first half of 2016) positive rates of different types of influenza virus. Results A total of 1,341 specimens were positive for influenza A and 490 for influenza B. The majority of infected patients were 1\textendash 11 years old (87.7\%). The ARIMA model could effectively predict the positive rate of influenza virus in a short time. ARIMA(0,0,11), SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)12, ARIMA(0,0,1) and SARIMA(0,0,1)(1,0,1)12 were suitable for B(Victoria), B(Yamagata), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H3N2), respectively. Conclusion Additional policies must be formulated to prevent and control influenza. The wide use of influenza vaccines, especially for influenza B, especially for influenza B(Yamagata) and B(Victoria), can potentially reduce the effects of influenza on children of China.},
