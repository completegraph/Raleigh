  abstract = {In recent years, crime scholars and practitioners have pointed to the potential benefits of focusing police crime prevention efforts on crime places. Research suggests that there is significant clustering of crime in small places or "hot spots." A number of researchers have argued that crime problems can be reduced more efficiently if police officers focused their attention to these deviant places. In this article, we update and improve upon a previously completed Campbell Collaboration systematic review of the effects of hot spots policing and crime. Meta-analyses were used to determine the size, direction, and statistical significance of the overall impact of hot spots policing strategies on crime. The results of our research suggests that hot spots policing generates small but noteworthy crime reductions, and these crime control benefits diffuse into areas immediately surrounding targeted crime hot spots. Our analyses find that problem-oriented policing interventions generate larger mean effect sizes when compared to interventions that simply increase levels of traditional police actions in crime hot spots. We also find that only a small number of studies examine the impacts of hot spots policing on police-community relations. The extant research on this topic, however, suggests that community members have positive reactions to these focused policing actions.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The authors were unable to find a comprehensive study on crime hotspot detection and prediction while conducting this SLR. Therefore, to the best of author's knowledge, this study is the premier attempt to critically analyze the existing literature along with presenting potential challenges faced by current crime hotspot detection and prediction systems. The SLR is conducted by thoroughly consulting top five scientific databases (such as IEEE, Science Direct, Springer, Scopus, and ACM), and synthesized 49 different studies on crime hotspot detection and prediction after critical review. This study unfolds the following major aspects: 1) the impact of data mining and machine learning approaches, especially clustering techniques in crime hotspot detection; 2) the utility of time series analysis techniques and deep learning techniques in crime trend prediction; 3) the inclusion of spatial and temporal information in crime datasets making the crime prediction systems more accurate and reliable; 4) the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art techniques and the future research directions. Moreover, the SLR aims to provide a core foundation for the research on spatio-temporal crime prediction applications while highlighting several challenges related to the accuracy of crime hotspot detection and prediction applications.},

  abstract = {Hotspot mapping is a popular analytical technique that is used to help identify where to target police and crime reduction resources. In essence, hotspot mapping is used as a basic form of crime prediction, relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed. A number of different mapping techniques are used for identifying hotspots of crime - point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas (e.g. Census areas), spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping and kernel density estimation (KDE). Several research studies have discussed the use of these methods for identifying hotspots of crime, usually based on their ease of use and ability to spatially interpret the location, size, shape and orientation of clusters of crime incidents. Yet surprising, very little research has compared how hotspot mapping techniques can accurately predict where crimes will occur in the future. This research uses crime data for a period before a fixed date (that has already passed) to generate hotspot maps, and test their accuracy for predicting where crimes will occur next. Hotspot mapping accuracy is compared in relation to the mapping technique that is used to identify concentrations of crime events (thematic mapping of Census Output Areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and KDE) and by crime type - four crime types are compared (burglary, street crime, theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles). The results from this research indicate that crime hotspot mapping prediction abilities differ between the different techniques and differ by crime type. KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others, while street crime hotspot maps were consistently better at predicting where future street crime would occur when compared to results for the hotspot maps of different crime types. The research offers the opportunity to benchmark comparative research of other techniques and other crime types, including comparisons between advanced spatial analysis techniques and predic-tion mapping methods. Understanding how hotspot mapping can predict spatial patterns of crime and how different mapping methods compare will help to better inform their application in practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Geographical information systems have found successful applications to prediction and decision-making in several areas of vital importance to contemporary society. This article demonstrates how they can be combined with machine learning algorithms to create crime prediction models for urban areas. Selected point of interest (POI) layers from OpenStreetMap are used to derive attributes describing micro-areas, which are assigned crime risk classes based on police crime records. POI attributes then serve as input attributes for learning crime risk prediction models with classification learning algorithms. The experimental results obtained for four UK urban areas suggest that POI attributes have high predictive utility. Classification models using these attributes, without any form of location identification, exhibit good predictive performance when applied to new, previously unseen micro-areas. This makes them capable of crime risk prediction for newly developed or dynamically changing neighborhoods. The high dimensionality of the model input space can be considerably reduced without predictive performance loss by attribute selection or principal component analysis. Models trained on data from one area achieve a good level of prediction quality when applied to another area, which makes it possible to transfer or combine crime risk prediction models across different urban areas.},

The measures are illustrated using hypothetical examples. We illustrate how PPAI could identify the best model for a given problem, as well as how the expected utility measure can be used to combine different measures in a way that is the most appropriate for the problem at hand. It is important to develop measures that empower the practitioner with the ability to input the choices and preferences that are most appropriate for the problem at hand and to combine multiple measures.

These systems are an example of coproduction as they join government and residents in the collaborative maintenance of the urban commons. The current article takes an applied evolutionary approach to understanding the motivations underlying constituent participation in this process, positing that reporting an issue in the public space is reflective of territoriality-that is, to feel ownership for spaces and objects. This territoriality thesis is examined in 3 studies of the 311 system in Boston, Massachusetts, focusing on whether reporting and the motivations for it are centered around the home. Study 1 demonstrated that the vast majority of those using 311's traditional channels (i.e., hotline and Internet) reported issues exclusively within a narrow range around their homes. Study 2 found that a smart phone application, which presumably increases mobility, expanded this range, but only into other spaces in the neighborhood. In Study 3, a field experiment found that advertisements for the 311 system that prime territoriality by referencing the local neighborhood were more effective in encouraging reporting than those referencing the broader city. Implications for extending research and policy on territoriality and maintenance of the urban commons and for coproduction policies, more generally, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Keywords: Predictive policing; Near-repeat; Machine learning; Risk terrain modeling; Hotspot analysis The main objective of this study is to test and compare the prediction performance of three of the most common predictive policing methods. A near-repeat model, a supervised machine learning model, and a risk terrain model are tested and compared against each other using retrospective analysis of home burglary crime data from a Belgian city. Hotspot analysis is included as a baseline. Predictions are made for three different months (January, May and September 2017) to account for seasonal differences. Variations in spatial context (city center vs. suburbs) and the number of predicted risk locations are also tested. Prediction performance is measured using accuracy, near-hit rate, precision and F1-score. The results show that there are some notable differences in prediction performance between the model types across the tested variations. In general, the ensemble model tends to be the most consistent high performer across all tested variations. Also notable is that hotspot analysis is not clearly outperformed by the other methods. The different methods have their own strengths and weaknesses and optimal prediction performance crucially depends on the specific location context. More comparative analyses of predictive policing methods in different contexts are needed to gain a more complete picture. Future research could also focus on how combining methods can help improve crime prediction performance.

  abstract = {Hypotheses from General Strain theory are addressed using data from a random sample of adults in Raleigh, NC. Analyses examine three issues: (1) whether strain predicts self-projected criminal behavior; controlling for past self-reported crime; (2) whether negative emotions mediate the relationship between strain and projected crime; and (3) whether social support and criminal peers serve as contingencies or mediators for strain in predicting criminality. Results are generally consistent with previous studies focusing on youth. Three of four measures of strain are found to predict the crime measures. However, that relationship is not mediated by negative emotion and the measures of social support and criminal peers do not act as contingencies or mediators. The results suggest that strain may not operate through negative emotions and that theoretical refinement is needed to identify which potential contingencies are likely to be operating under various circumstances.},

Controlling for a set of micro-level covariates as well as unobserved neighborhood-level effects using negative binomial regression models, it is found that detritus- and infrastructurerelated calls for service have a positive, but small effect on crime. The results suggest that 311 calls for service are a valid indicator of physical disorder where available, and the findings partially confirm the broken windows theory. Given the small effects though, reducing physical disorder is unlikely to result in appreciable declines in crime.},

  abstract = {Crime has always been one of the important social issues that people care about. In the problem of urban security, preventing and reducing crime is one of the primary tasks of the police. Crime hotspot prediction can use historical crime data to infer geographic areas where crime may occur in the future. Machine learning is the mainstream method of current crime prediction method.But in the era of big data, more and more data information appears in the eyes of people, it is far from enough to use historical crime data to infer crime hotspots. Therefore, this paper is based on the random forest algorithm, first of all,divides the study areas into four categories according to the hot spot distribution based on the historical crime data: frequent hot areas, common hot areas, occasional hot areas and non-hot areas,and then, representative covariates from the non-historical crime data are added to the prediction model to explore the changes in the result accuracy of crime prediction based on the historical crime data by integrating different covariates. The data is based on real data, and the experimental results show that compared with the inference method based only on historical crime data, the accuracy of the model with covariates is improved compared with that without covariates.},

  abstract = {Crime prediction is of great significance to the formulation of policing strategies and the implementation of crime prevention and control. Machine learning is the current mainstream prediction method. However, few studies have systematically compared different machine learning methods for crime prediction. This paper takes the historical data of public property crime from 2015 to 2018 from a section of a large coastal city in the southeast of China as research data to assess the predictive power between several machine learning algorithms. Results based on the historical crime data alone suggest that the LSTM model outperformed KNN, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and convolutional neural networks. In addition, the built environment data of points of interests (POIs) and urban road network density are input into LSTM model as covariates. It is found that the model with built environment covariates has better prediction effect compared with the original model that is based on historical crime data alone. Therefore, future crime prediction should take advantage of both historical crime data and covariates associated with criminological theories. Not all machine learning algorithms are equally effective in crime prediction.},
